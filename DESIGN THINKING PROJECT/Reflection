This project taught me how important creativit and collaboration are in solving real-world problems. 
Writing the report and working on the prototype pushed me to improve my design and leadership skills. 
It also showed me how design thinking can turn ideas into practical solutions. 
Moving forward, i'll continue building my skills and exploring new tools to reach my goal
of becoming a creative designer.
